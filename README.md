## 📂 Project Ideas

# Games
* Tavern IDEL
    - Step into the shoes of a bustling tavern manager in this fast-paced, top-down simulation. As your reputation grows, so does your tavern—expanding into new areas like bedrooms, a library, private lounges, and more. What starts as a humble gathering spot evolves into a sprawling hub of commerce and culture. Complexity increases with time, challenging players to manage space, staff, inventory, and unpredictable events.
* Spin Game
    - At its core, Spin Game is simple: follow the rules, beat the game. But there's a twist—the rules can change at any moment. One minute you're in a straightforward battle, and the next, you're fighting blind, shifting through dimensions, or facing off in rule-bending one-on-one duels. With dynamic environments and an ever-evolving rule set, every match is unpredictable and increasingly complex.
* Snow Day
    - Manage a futuristic survival train traversing an ice-covered planet with average temperatures below -178.4°C. Set in a year of your choosing between 10,000 and 19,999, you’ll take command of a derailed, destroyed, or abandoned train as you struggle to sustain heat, power, water, and food for your rescued citizens. As more survivors are brought aboard, the challenges intensify—turning your train into humanity’s last hope in a frozen wasteland. You must report your finds through hallarusly outdated technology - Bulletin Board System (BBS) with Dial-Up Modem: A remote facility on this planet runs a dial-up bulletin board system accessible only via rotary-dial telephone uplinks. Transmission speed is capped at 14.4 kbps, and if someone picks up another line, the whole transmission restarts. Authentication is done with modem handshake tones that are cross-referenced against a paper Rolodex.
* Hotel
    - A desolate, fire-gutted hotel looms at the corner of Grandview Dr. and S. Industrial Dr., its charred frame a remnant of a mysterious blaze in the summer of 1999. Before its fiery demise, guests often reported witnessing bizarre phenomena—new music, television shows, and films that existed nowhere else. No one ever discovered the origin of this content or who was responsible for its creation. Stranger still were the accounts of new, unlisted rooms appearing overnight, along with unexplained items such as food, blankets, and pillows that didn’t match the hotel’s inventory. In 1993, an internal investigation was launched into the behavior of the staff, many of whom were described as disturbingly odd, even insane. While background checks revealed spotless records before employment, employees reportedly grew more unhinged the longer they remained on staff. Yet, there were no documented incidents of physical harm. To protect its reputation, the hotel quietly closed off 55 rooms from its original 200-room layout. However, by 2002, official records inexplicably listed 261 rooms. The newly “discovered” rooms matched the hotel’s architecture perfectly, as though they had always been there. In this story, you play as a rebellious teenager drawn to the mysteries of the abandoned structure. What begins as a thrill-seeking adventure quickly descends into horror, as you face unnatural creatures, uncover unsettling employee journals, and come face-to-face with truths that defy logic—and sanity.
