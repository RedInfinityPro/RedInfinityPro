* This project is a Python-based game developed using the Pygame library. It includes libraries and modules like `pygame`, `random`, `time`, `pymunk`, `sys`, `pygame_widgets`, `asyncio`, and `aiohttp`. The game window is created using Pygame, and the game uses the `pymunk` library for physics simulation. The game uses various colors and text objects for displaying messages, buttons for menu, shop, level up, and restart functionalities, and circle sprites for game entities. The game loop handles events, updates the game state, and manages game-over conditions and restart functionality. The project also integrates an asynchronous web server using the `aiohttp` library.
