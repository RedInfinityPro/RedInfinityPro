## 📂 Project Ideas
# Games:
    # Hotel
        - A looming, fire-scarred skeleton of a once-grand hotel stands at the intersection of Grandview Drive and South Industrial Drive. The ruin’s charred beams whisper tales of the mysterious inferno that consumed it in the summer of 1999, yet many questions remain unanswered. Before its fiery demise, guests spoke of uncanny experiences: discovering music tracks, television shows, and films that existed nowhere else—works that vanished without a trace. Even more unsettling were reports of secret corridors and brand-new rooms materializing overnight, stocked with orphaned blankets, pillows, and meals that defied the hotel’s inventory. In 1993, management quietly commissioned an internal investigation into its staff—employees who, according to witness testimony, seemed progressively unhinged the longer they stayed. Their backgrounds had been spotless, but their behavior grew increasingly erratic, filled with obsessive experiments and midnight rituals. Miraculously, no guest ever suffered physical harm, yet the atmosphere thickened with dread. To conceal these anomalies, the hotel sealed off 55 rooms from its original 200-room blueprint. Then, as if reality itself had rewritten history, official records in 2002 listed 261 rooms, each seamlessly integrated into the hotel’s architecture as though they had always existed. You play as Morgan, a headstrong teenager driven by rumors and adrenaline. What begins as a daring nocturnal exploration rapidly spirals into a fight for survival. As you delve deeper, you’ll confront grotesque, otherworldly creatures, decipher fragmented employee journals detailing forbidden experiments, and uncover truths that shatter the boundary between the natural and the impossible. The hotel’s charred halls beckon you toward their darkest secrets—if you dare to stay until dawn.
    # Tavern IDEL
        - Adopt the mantle of an ambitious tavern manager in this vibrant, top-down simulation where every choice shapes your establishment’s legacy. Begin with a modest taproom: a handful of tables, a creaky bar, and curious locals seeking refuge from the streets. As word of your hospitality spreads, new opportunities arise: expand into cozy guest chambers, a hushed library of ancient tomes, and private lounges gilded with filigreed lanterns. Oversee every detail—from designing chamber layouts and recruiting bartenders, bards, and guards, to curating a menu of spiced ales, exotic dishes, and rare elixirs. Stock inventory carefully, balancing local brews against imported delicacies. Hire entertainers to stave off restless patrons or equip your staff with scrolls of crowd-control magic to defuse bar brawls. But growth brings complexity: clandestine dealings with smugglers, midnight raids by rival taverns, and unpredictable events—like a sudden dragon sighting outside the windows or a cursed shipment of chalices that turn drinkers into stone. Will your tavern become the crown jewel of the realm, a den of iniquity, or collapse under its own weight?
    # TowerDefiance
        - Repository: RedInfinityPro/TowerDefiance
        - Conquer an infinite, dynamically generated map—one segment at a time. Each territory challenges you with hordes of enemies defined by four attributes—Health, Armor, Speed, and Attack Damage—visually represented by colored bars. Build and upgrade your empire: erect defensive towers (Red for range, Green for armor-piercing, Blue for balanced firepower), mines to harvest resources, and storage silos for ammunition. Defend reclaimed segments against surprise assaults. Research upgrades that enhance bullet types, firing rates, damage output, mining efficiency, and storage capacity. Will your city thrive or be swallowed by the ever-advancing darkness?
    # JavaSpinGame
        - Repository: RedInfinityPro/JavaSpinGame
        - A multiplayer board game where the rules twist with every spin of the wheel. Navigate a vibrant map filled with random challenges—momentary blindness, sudden silence or missing clues. Scavenge for treasures, forge alliances, and equip ever-changing gear to battle monsters or rival players. Core Systems: Player Profile: Health, Armor, Speed, Gold, XP/Level, Dynamic Shop: Rotate stock between magical artifacts, powerful weapons, or even unpredictable “shopkeeper duels.”, Unpredictable Events: From rags-to-riches windfalls to curses that bankrupt you, no two sessions play the same. Can you adapt faster than the board itself?
    # CardGame
        - Repositories: RedInfinityPro/CardGame_Python, RedInfinityPro/CardGame
        - Duel opponents with a personalized deck of mystical cards. Each card falls into one of three archetypes: Cursed Cards: Debilitate enemy units, lock down abilities, or force your opponent to discard. Bonus Cards: Grant stat boosts or even fight autonomously for brief bursts—but beware their volatility. Standard Cards: Possess Attack, Armor, Health, Level, and Rarity. Rarity tiers—Grey, Blue, Green, Purple, and Gold—scale a card’s base stats exponentially, while leveling up further enhances their prowess. Craft the ultimate deck synergy or specialize in sabotage to outwit every challenger.
    # Snow-Day
        - Repositories: RedInfinityPro/SnowDay-GodotEdition, RedInfinityPro/Snow-Day
        - Command a futuristic survival train traversing an ice world where temperatures plummet below −178.4 °C. Set between the years 10 000 and 19 999, you inherit a derailed locomotive bristling with ruined carriages. Rescue stranded survivors and retrofit your train into a mobile bastion of heat, power, water, and food. As your survivor count swells, so do the logistical nightmares: blackout storms, boiler malfunctions, and dwindling supplies. Unique Twist: Communicate findings via a hilariously outdated Bulletin Board System (BBS). Dial in using a rotary telephone uplink capped at 14.4 kbps. If another line picks up, your transmission shatters and you must start over. Authentication comes from matching modem handshake tones to entries in a dusty Rolodex. Can you preserve humanity’s spark—or will the ice claim you all?
    # Project-47
        - Repository: RedInfinityPro/Project-47
        - A universe-spanning capitalist sandbox. Acquire planets, launch rockets, establish interplanetary businesses, and build empires from scratch. Navigate fluctuating markets, cosmic disasters, and political intrigue. Will you become a galactic mogul—or watch your ventures implode?
    # Pop-Arcade
        - Repositories: RedInfinityPro/Vending-Machine-Arcade, RedInfinityPro/ArcadePop
        - A web-based arcade immersed in the satirical world of Idiocracy. Host user-generated mini-games within a virtual vending machine interface. Each game is “packaged” as a custom soda—design its branding, name, color, and shape. Earn “BRAWNDO” currency by playing games or trading soda shares on the pop market. Do you serve nostalgia, novelty, or pure chaos?
    # The Bones of Society
        - Repository: RedInfinityPro/The-Bones-of-Society
        - The afterlife is real—and it’s bureaucratic. Every arriving soul is randomly cast as either Bone or Flesh. Choose your path: challenge discrimination between humans and aliens, or uncover the secret that binds bone and flesh. Why are some species deemed more “highly intelligent,” and what grants true immortality? Navigate factions, forge alliances, and decide whether to uphold divine order—or dismantle it.
    # Turbo-Bet-Raceway
        - Repository: RedInfinityPro/Turbo-Bet-Raceway
        - Oversee a high-octane automotive organization pushing cars to their mechanical limits. Design your own team flag, blueprint custom vehicles, and bet on performance trials. Will your engineering genius win the day—or will your designs crumble under pressure?
    
# Tools:
    # MoneyClock
        - Repository: RedInfinityPro/MoneyClock
        - Simulate a live stock market where each company is represented by a ticking clock displaying its net worth in real time. Watch fortunes rise and fall at a glance—will you buy, sell, or hold?
    # BookSelf
        - Repository: RedInfinityPro/BookSelf
        - A digital bookshelf app that catalogs your physical reading materials. Add titles, track progress, and discover new recommendations based on your existing collection
    # Movie/Music Recommendation Software
        - Build a personal media library by logging your DVDs and CDs. Input your favorite shows and albums, and receive intelligent suggestions for what to watch or listen to next—perfect for cinephiles and audiophiles alike.
